# MIPS_32_Verilog_Implementation
This repository contains all  the modules and test benches related to our work on implementation of RISC V processor.

The following five files together make our fetch unit branch condition has not been added yet in the logic
          1.PC_reg_synchronous.v
          2.NPC_REG.v
          3.instruction_memory.v
          4.IF_ID_stage.v
          
Currently only IF stage and deceoding stage has been implemented and that too without branch instruction..so currently modifying these codes to accomodate all the instructions.
